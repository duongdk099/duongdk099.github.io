            <h3>3 Things That Never Made Sense About The Show <q>13 reason why</q></h3> 
            <h5>16 Oct 2020</h5>

            <p>Some of you may know, but others don't</p>
            <h1> <b> What Kind Of Parent Would Willingly Send Their Child To Liberty High School? </b></h1>
            <img src="../../images/Articles/13_reasons_why_1.jpg" width="400" alt="" srcset="">
            <p>One of the biggest things fans don't understand about 13 Reasons Why is how this school kept getting new students year after year, and frankly, how it stayed open. In the first season alone, two characters died. In addition, the school nearly had a school shooting, was sued by Hannah's family, had an extensive and long history with athletes taking advantage of female students, and had three more students found dead within the course of the series.</p>
            <p>And yet, year after year, students like Ani and Winston were allowed to transfer to Liberty High without their parents even batting an eye at the controversy.</p>
            <h1><b>Justin Not Being Aware Of The Clubhouse In Season 2</b></h1>
            <img src="../../images/Articles/13-Reasons-Why-Clubhouse.jpg" width="400" alt="" srcset="">
            <p>Aside from the trial of Hannah Baker's case against Liberty High School, a major plot point of 13 Reasons Why season 2 revolved around trying to figure out where the clubhouse was and who was involved in it. While that was a big mystery, the biggest mystery of all was the fact that Justin Foley apparently did not know anything about it.</p>
            <p>For those who don't remember, the clubhouse was located on the baseball field and was where Liberty High athletes took girls to fool around and oftentimes, take advantage of. Not only was Justin an athlete, but he was also Bryce's best friend, who was practically in charge of the Clubhouse during his time at Liberty. We don't understand why Bryce wouldn't have told Justin about the place, especially when he let Marcus, who wasn't even an athlete, into the clubhouse.</p>

            <h1><b>Why Did Clay Feel Responsible For The Bryce Cover-Up In Season Four?</b></h1>
            <img src="../../images/Articles/13-Reasons-Why-Clay-Jenson.jpg" width="400" alt="">
            <p>One of the most confusing things about the fourth season of 13 Reasons Why was the reason for Clay's deteriorating mental state. Sure, it makes sense that he would be anxious and depressed, especially since he has been since Hannah's death and never truly sought out professional help.</p>
            <p>This season, however, was the most peculiar because it felt like Clay's issues stemmed from the fact that they framed Monty for Bryce's murder. What doesn't make sense though is why Clay felt so guilty about the cover-up when he wasn't the one who thought of or told the story to the police. That was all Ani.</p>
